# Privacy Policy — Fashion Trend Recommender (PoC)
**Effective:** 2025-09-07  
**Contact:** rongjiinc@gmail.com

## 1) Who we are
This is a personal prototype application (“App”) created by Jiin, based in Australia.

## 2) What this App does
The App analyzes fashion images to surface trending styles and personalize recommendations.
It only accesses Pinterest/Reddit content from sources the user owns or explicitly authorizes.
The App does **not** post content.

## 3) Data we collect and why
- **Platform data (read-only):** image URLs, images, pin/post IDs, board/subreddit names,
  titles/descriptions, timestamps.  
  **Purpose:** style classification, trend analysis, recommendations.
- **User-provided images (optional):** photos you upload for personalization.  
  **Purpose:** compute non-reversible embeddings to rank looks for you.
- **Technical logs:** basic request/diagnostic logs.  
  **Purpose:** reliability and abuse prevention.

## 4) How we process data
Images may be downloaded and converted to vector embeddings for similarity search.
We do **not** sell personal data or message other users.

## 5) Storage & retention
PoC mode stores data locally or on a private server. Data is retained only as long as needed
for testing. You may request deletion at any time via the contact above.

## 6) Sharing
No third-party sharing except service providers strictly necessary to run the App
(e.g., storage), bound by confidentiality.

## 7) Security
Access tokens are stored securely (environment variables or secrets vault).
Transport uses HTTPS. Access is limited to the developer.

## 8) Your choices & rights
You can revoke platform access at any time. Request a copy or deletion of your data
via the contact above.

## 9) Children
Not intended for children under 13.

## 10) International transfers
Data may be processed in Australia and, if cloud services are used, other regions with appropriate safeguards.

## 11) Changes
We may update this policy; changes will be posted with a new “Effective” date.
